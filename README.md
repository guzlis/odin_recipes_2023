# odin_recipes_2023
This is a redo of my previous "odin-recipes" project, which was not completed due to me having to restart The Odin Project. With this project, I aim to demonstrate the HTML knowledge I have aquired so far. It is possible that I will revisit this project after completing the "CSS" chapters.

Note 23/02/2023: It has come to my attention that I skipped a Mac OSX exclusive step in the "Setting up git" chapter, hence why there is currently still a ".DS_Store" in the commit. I repeated said steps, and now this should no longer occur. I will clean up this repository once I feel more confident in using git.
