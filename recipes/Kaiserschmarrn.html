    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Now, you may take a look at the picture and think to yourself "wait a second, this looks like a scrambled pancake!". Well, that's because that is <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> what it is! Though the exact origin of this dessert is unknown, most creation myths surrounding it involve someone messing up a pancake and going "screw this, I'll serve this anyway". Additionally, a lot of said myths also involve the royal house of Habsburg in one way or another, hence why it is called <strong>Kaiser</strong>schmarrn ("Kaiser" being the german word for "emperor").</p>
        <p>Why I am writing about all of this? Truth be told, I don't know, but I guess the existence of this dish proves one thing right. In the words of the great late Bob Ross: "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents". Should we keep this in mind on the rest of our Odin Project journey? Maybe, who knows.</p>
