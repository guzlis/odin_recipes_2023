    <h1>Viennese Style Potato Salad</h1>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>What would the cuisine of any germanic country be without potatoes? Probably a lot healthier, now that I think about it...</p>
            <p>Unlike other potato salads, the viennese potato salad is eaten warm. While it is usually classified as a side dish, it can also be eaten on its own. And if I may say so myself: it is an excellent hangover remedy. Will serve approximately four people. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
         <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 kg Waxy potatoes</li>
                    <li>2 red onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>0.5 litres warm beef broth</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons of white wine or apple cider vinegar <em>(Hint: for true viennese authenticity, try to get your hands on a bottle of <a href="austriansupermarket.com/en/mautner-markhof-hesperiden-essig">Hesperiden vinegar</a>)</em></li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil <em>(The original recipe calls for canola oil, but other vegetable oils will work as well)</em></li>
                    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>A pinch of pepper</li>

                    <li>1 teaspoon sugar <em>(optional)</em></li>
